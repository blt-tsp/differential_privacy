Differential privacy for a simple CNN model. 

** Differential privacy is a framework for data privacy that aims to protect individuals' sensitive information 
while allowing useful insights to be drawn from aggregated data. In simple terms, it ensures that the presence 
or absence of any single individual's data doesn't significantly impact the results of an analysis. 
This is achieved by adding carefully calibrated noise to the data before it is used for computations or analysis, 
preventing the extraction of specific details about any individual. 

** The goal is to balance the need for accurate analysis with the protection of individuals' privacy in datasets.
